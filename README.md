## Overview of Analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to determine the feasibility of creating a bike sharing community similar to the CitiBike community in New York, New York. To answer this question several analyses were run using Tableau Public to visually show the answers to our questions. Some of the questions we wanted to answer are:
* What is the busiest times of day for bike rentals?
* Which gender uses the bikes more?
* What is the slowest time of day for bike use? (To determine the best time for maintanance)
* What are the most popular starting and ending locations for bike rides?
* What is the average duration of each bike ride?

## Results of Analysis

### Checkout Times by Number of Users and Gender

<img width="1135" alt="Checkout_Times_by_gender" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/112291888/208529456-c717d6ef-ea3d-4236-99a4-a619e3058b85.png">

Looking at the above images we can see that the most frequent duration for a bike ride is around 10 minutes, with over 140,000 rides total. Looking at the gender breakdown, we can see that men are more frequently using bikes with the trip durations still around 10 minutes. 

### Trips by Gender, Hour, and Weekday

Looking at the visualizations we can see that the most popular times for bike rentals, both overall and for each gender separately, is Thursdays between the hours of 5:00 and 6:00 PM. This is most likely due to most individuals leaving work around this time and heading home or to dinner with their friends or family.

### Top Starting and Ending Locations

<img width="1303" alt="Top_ending_locations" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/112291888/208529892-c88ab249-d221-4434-8012-136980a658e5.png">

Here we see the top starting locations in green and the top ending location in orange. The vast majority of the bike rides start and stop in downtown Manhattan. This makes sense as many of the top tourist locations in New York are in downtown and as a fair number of the customers are single use and not subscriber, it would follow that a good number of them are tourists. 

## Summary of Analysis

All together, looking at the data the majority of users are male and are subscribers to the CitiBike service; making up more than half of the total users. This is most likely due to the gender disparity in public safety between men and women in large urban areas. On top of this the majority of rides are around or under 10 minutes in duration and taking place in downtown Manhattan. 

## Recommendations for Further Analysis

Going forward we would recommend an analysis of the Des Moine, Iowa area to asertain the demographics of the area as well as looking into the public transportation data. Part of the success of CitiBike in New Work is that using public transportation in urban areas has become a part of the culture, and thus has the infrastructure to support a bike sharing service. In places like Des Moine this is less previlant and thus the infrastructure to support a bike sharing service may not be there. The only way to find out it to look into the data and perfrom the analyses. Another aspect to look into would be the tourist presence in Des Moine. Looking at the data we can see that a fair number of CitiBik customers are likely to be tourists, if Des Moine does not have a large tourist population than a bike sharing service may not be as popular.
